# Welcome to Autonomous Agent Testing

Autonomous Agent Testing focuses on evaluating features introduced in the Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) 1694. This includes testing the creation and voting mechanisms for proposals to ensure the governance model operates seamlessly. Additionally, it verifies functionalities such as:

- Registering and deregistering as a Delegated Representative (DRep).
- Managing stake registrations and deregistrations.
- Performing ADA transfers.
- Triggering operations manually, via a CRON schedule, or through event filtering.

The testing process ensures these operations are secure, efficient, and aligned with the decentralized governance objectives of Cardano's Voltaire era.
